## let's find xûr

This is meant to be a personal project to get comfortable using programming languages other than C. I also want to get some experience working with online APIs. 

Run the following commands in order to download and run the script.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/georgedance/xurfinder
cd xurfinder
python src/main.py
```

alternatively, you could use the simple `[Makefile](/Makefile)` to run the script. (This is just a convenience for ymself out of habit.)
```sh
make run
# or
make
```
